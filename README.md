## Hi, I'm Muhammad Mehdi 👋

I am a cybersecurity undergraduate with a strong focus on SOC-related skills and hands-on learning.

### 🔹 What I work on
- CCNA networking labs (Packet Tracer)
- Ethernet switching, MAC learning, ARP, and traffic analysis
- SOC-related labs using TryHackMe
- Identity & access concepts through Microsoft/Azure learning

### 🔹 Skills & Tools
- Networking fundamentals (CCNA level)
- Ethernet LAN switching & routing basics
- Packet Tracer
- TCP/IP, ARP, ICMP
- SIEM & SOC fundamentals

### 🔹 Current Focus
Building a strong foundation in networking and security through practical labs and real-world scenarios.

📌 Most of my work here reflects **hands-on labs and configurations**, not just theory.
